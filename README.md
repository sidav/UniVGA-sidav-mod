UniVGA-sidav

A modification of cyrillic UniVGA glyphs for better resembling some old DOS font which name I don't know.
It is made for myself, it is not so nice or proportional or something, so I suggest you not to use it. 

Original font is taken from there: https://github.com/mirror/reactos/tree/master/reactos/media/fonts


As this font is 99% UniVGA, it's license should be the same, I guess. So: 
The UNI-VGA font can be distributed and modified freely, according to the X license.

Author of original UniVGA is Dmitry Bolkhovityanov, big thanks to him.
